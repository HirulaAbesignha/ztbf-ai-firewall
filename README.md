# ZTBF – Zero-Trust Behavior Firewall

ZTBF is an AI-driven, zero-trust security system designed to enforce continuous, behavior-based access control across users, service accounts, APIs, and cloud workloads.

Unlike traditional firewalls and IAM solutions that rely on static rules or one-time authentication, ZTBF continuously evaluates behavioral risk using machine learning to detect abnormal activity even when valid credentials are used.

The system ingests identity, cloud, network, and API telemetry to build behavior models, generate risk scores, and dynamically enforce actions such as alerts, step-up authentication, or access isolation.

ZTBF is cloud-native, scalable, and privacy-aware, with explainable security decisions designed for SOC and audit use cases.

This project is currently in the research and architecture phase and is intended for defensive security research and education only.
