# Threat Model: AI-Driven Zero-Trust Behavior Firewall (ZTBF)

## Executive Summary

This threat model defines the adversarial landscape that ZTBF is designed to defend against. Traditional security controls (firewalls, IDS, antivirus) fail to detect **behavior-based threats** where attackers use legitimate credentials and authorized access patterns. ZTBF addresses this gap through continuous behavioral verification.
